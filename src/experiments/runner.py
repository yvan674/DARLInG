"""Runner.

Runs the required code based on provided arguments. The difference between this
and train.py is train.py is only the training loop. This should take in a
set of arguments, so that it can run experiments from the command line, and
then invoke the correct training and test loops. This also sets up the dataset,
dataloaders, etc.
